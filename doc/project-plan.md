# Project Plan - Budgetor
## Summary
This project's goal is to create a low-impact way to create and manage a budget and provide a way to track every penny that comes into your wallet and every penny that leaves your wallet.  The project aims to create the most amount of convenience for the end-user by initially setting up a budget and then becoming as hands off as possible.  This will be done by interfacing with the end-users chosen financial institution and automatically importing recent transactions into Budgetors interface and allowing the user to assign a budget category and add a comment to that transaction.  It will then display all available useful information in the form of graphs to inform the user of trends that will help manage their finances.
